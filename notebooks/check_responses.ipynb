      "\n",
      "A player values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if for their permutation $$$p$$$, $$$p_a > p_b$$$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $$$b$$$ to Alice in exchange for card $$$a$$$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if $$$a > b$$$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n",
      "\n",
