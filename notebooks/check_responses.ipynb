      "<|im_start|>think\n",
      "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of minimal coprime segments [l, r] within a given range [L, R]. Hmm. So first, I need to understand what a minimal coprime segment is.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the note, a minimal coprime segment is one that doesn't contain any other coprime segment except itself. So, for a segment to be minimal, it must be coprime (l and r are coprime), and any proper subsegment (like [l+1, r], etc.) must not be coprime. Wait, no. Wait, the definition says it does not contain any coprime segment not equal to itself. Oh right, so the minimal coprime segments are those where the segment itself is coprime, and all of its proper subsegments are not coprime. Wait, no. Wait, the minimal coprime segments are those that are coprime, and any larger segment that contains them (like their parent) is not coprime. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem statement says: a minimal coprime segment is a coprime segment that does not contain any coprime segment (other than itself). So, for example, if a segment [a,b] is coprime, but there exists a segment [c,d] where a ≤ c ≤ d ≤ b, and [c,d] is coprime and [c,d] is not equal to [a,b], then [a,b] is not minimal. So the minimal ones are the ones that are coprime, and all their subsegments (except themselves) are not coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. The problem says: a minimal coprime segment is a coprime segment that does not contain any coprime segment not equal to itself. So, the minimal coprime segments are those coprime segments which are not contained as a subsegment in any other coprime segment (except themselves). So, for example, if [l, r] is coprime, but there exists [a, b] where l ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r and [a, b] is coprime and [a, b] is not equal to [l, r], then [l, r] is not minimal. So the minimal coprimes are the ones that are coprime, and their only coprime subsegments are themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the task is to count all such [l, r] in the given [L, R] that are coprime and for which there's no larger coprime segment containing them as a subsegment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but how can a segment [x, y] be contained within [l, r] and also be coprime? For example, if [l, r] is [2,4], then [3,4] is a subsegment. If [3,4] is coprime (3 and 4 are coprime), then [2,4] can't be minimal because it contains [3,4]. So in that case, [2,4] is not minimal. So the minimal coprimes are the ones where any subsegment (other than themselves) is not coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are exactly the coprime segments [a, b] such that there is no proper subsegment [c, d] of [a, b] (other than [a, b] itself) that is coprime. Wait, no. Wait, the minimal coprime segments are those that are coprime, and any proper subsegment is not coprime. Because if there's a proper subsegment that is coprime, then the original segment contains that subsegment, which is a coprime segment, so the original would not be minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are the coprime segments where all their subsegments (except the entire segment) are not coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how do we find such segments?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think about the structure of such segments. Let's take a segment [a, b] which is coprime. For it to be minimal, any [c, d] where a ≤ c ≤ d ≤ b and [c, d] is coprime must be equal to [a, b]. So, the only coprime subsegment is the entire segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for [a, b] to be minimal, any subsegment [c, d] of [a, b] (proper or not) must not be coprime, unless it's the entire [a, b].\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the entire [a, b] is coprime. So any [c, d] that is a proper subsegment (c > a, d < b, etc.) must not be coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how can a segment [a, b] be coprime but all its proper subsegments are not coprime?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. Let's think of examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take [1, 1]. The segment is coprime (1 and 1 are coprime). There are no proper subsegments, so it's minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take [2,3]. The entire segment is coprime (gcd(2,3)=1). The proper subsegments are [2,2] and [3,3], which are not coprime (gcd(2,2)=2, gcd(3,3)=3). So [2,3] is minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: [2,4]. The entire segment is not coprime (gcd(2,4)=2). So it's not even a coprime segment, so it's not considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: [3,4]. Coprime. Proper subsegments are [3,3] (gcd 3) and [4,4] (gcd 4), so it's minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: [4,6]. The entire segment is not coprime (gcd 2). So not considered. Subsegments like [5,6] (coprime) would be part of it, so the original segment is not minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are those where the entire segment is coprime, and any of its proper subsegments (if they exist) are not coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem reduces to counting all segments [x, y] in [L, R] such that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. gcd(x, y) == 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For every proper subsegment [a, b] of [x, y], where x ≤ a ≤ b ≤ y and (a, b) != (x, y), gcd(a, b) != 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how can we count these segments efficiently, given that L and R can be up to 1e9 and there are up to 100 test cases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brute force is impossible here. So we need a mathematical approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think about the structure of such segments. For a segment [x, y] to satisfy condition 2, all of its proper subsegments must have a gcd greater than 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how can that be possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider that in the segment [x, y], every possible subsegment [a, b] (proper) must have gcd(a, b) > 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for any a and b where x ≤ a ≤ b ≤ y, and (a, b) != (x, y), we must have gcd(a, b) > 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how can that be possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's take [x, y] as a minimal coprime segment. Then, for any a >=x and b <= y, [a, b] must not be coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that's a very strong condition. For example, if x and y are consecutive integers, like x=3 and y=4. Then [3,4] is coprime, and any subsegment is either [3,3] (gcd 3) or [4,4] (gcd4), so it's minimal. But if x=2 and y=3, then [2,3] is coprime. Any subsegment is [2,2] (gcd2) or [3,3] (gcd3), so again minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about a segment like [2,4]. The entire segment is not coprime. So not considered. But if we have [2,3], which is coprime. Then any subsegment is [2,2] or [3,3], which are not coprime. So [2,3] is minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: [3,5]. The entire segment is coprime (gcd 1). The subsegments are [3,3] (gcd3), [4,4] (gcd4), [5,5] (gcd5), [3,4] (gcd1), [4,5] (gcd1), [3,5] (gcd1). Wait, but [3,4] is a subsegment with gcd 1. So [3,5] is not minimal, because it contains [3,4], which is a coprime subsegment. So even though the entire segment is coprime, if there's any proper subsegment that is coprime, the entire segment is not minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are those where the entire segment is coprime, and there are no proper subsegments that are coprime.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem is to count all [x, y] in [L, R] such that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. gcd(x, y) = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For all a in [x, y-1], and b in [a+1, y], gcd(a, b) > 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Because the subsegments can be of any length. So for example, in [x, y], any [a, b] where a >=x, b <=y, and (a, b) != (x, y) must have gcd(a, b) >1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how can such a segment exist?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think of a segment [x, y] where x and y are coprime, and between them, any two numbers (or consecutive numbers) have a gcd greater than 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but that's possible only if all numbers in the segment except x and y are not coprime with their neighbors. For example, in the case of [2,3], the numbers are 2 and 3. The subsegments are [2,2] (gcd2), [3,3] (gcd3), and [2,3] (gcd1). So the only coprime subsegment is the entire [2,3], so it's minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: [3,4]. The subsegments are [3,3] (gcd3), [4,4] (gcd4), and [3,4] (gcd1). So minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the segment is [3,5], then [3,4] is a subsegment with gcd 1, so the entire segment is not minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. So the minimal coprime segments are those where the entire segment is coprime, and any two consecutive numbers in the segment are not coprime. Because if there are two consecutive numbers in the segment that are coprime, then their subsegment [a, a+1] is coprime, which would make the entire segment not minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that's a key insight. Because if in the segment [x, y], there exists any pair of consecutive numbers (a, a+1) such that a and a+1 are coprime (which they always are, since consecutive numbers are coprime), then the subsegment [a, a+1] is coprime. Therefore, the entire segment [x, y] can't be minimal unless it's exactly [a, a+1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait. For example, [2,3] is minimal. It's a pair of consecutive numbers. But any longer segment that includes consecutive numbers would have a subsegment that is coprime. So the minimal coprime segments must be of length 1 or 2, and consist of consecutive numbers where their gcd is 1. Wait, but for length 2, the two numbers must be coprime. For example, [2,3] is coprime (gcd 1), and their consecutive numbers. So the subsegments are [2], [3], and [2,3]. The only coprime subsegment is the entire segment. So it's minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the segment is [2,4], then the subsegments [3,4] are coprime (gcd 1). So the entire segment is not minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the conclusion is that the minimal coprime segments are exactly those of length 1 (since their only subsegment is a single element, which is not coprime unless it's 1), or those of length 2 where the two elements are coprime and their consecutive elements (so their subsegments are single elements, which are not coprime except when the elements are 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but for a segment of length 2, [a, a+1], since a and a+1 are consecutive, their gcd is 1. So the entire segment is coprime. The subsegments are [a], [a+1]. Both are not coprime only if a and a+1 are 1. Because for example, [1,2] is a segment of length 2. The subsegments are [1] and [2], which are not coprime (since 1 and 1 are coprime, but wait, [1] is a single element. The gcd of 1 and 1 is 1. So the subsegment [1] is coprime. So [1,2] is a coprime segment, but its subsegment [1] is coprime. So [1,2] is not minimal. Wait, but according to the first example, [1,2] is part of the input, and the output is 1. Wait, in the first example, the input is 1 2, and the output is 1. The explanation says that [1,1] is minimal, but [1,2] is not because it contains [1,1]. But wait, [1,2] is coprime (gcd 1), but it contains [1,1], which is also coprime. So [1,2] is not minimal. So the minimal segments in that case are [1,1], which is 1. So the output is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the conclusion is that the minimal coprime segments are either:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Single elements [x, x] where x is 1. Because for x=1, the gcd(1,1) is 1, and there are no proper subsegments. So it's minimal. But if x is not 1, then [x, x] is coprime (since gcd(x,x) is x, which is 1 only if x is 1). Wait, no. Wait, for [x, x], the gcd is x. So [x, x] is coprime only if x is 1. Because if x is 2, then gcd(2,2)=2>1. So the only single-element segments that are coprime are [1,1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Or:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Pairs [a, a+1] where a and a+1 are coprime. But wait, a and a+1 are always coprime. So any consecutive pair is a coprime segment. But for such a pair to be minimal, their subsegments (the individual elements) must not be coprime. Wait, the subsegments of [a, a+1] are [a] and [a+1]. So [a] is coprime only if a is 1. Because [a] is a single element, so gcd(a, a) is a. So if a is 1, then [a] is coprime. Otherwise, [a] is not coprime. So for [a, a+1] to be minimal, the subsegments [a] and [a+1] must not be coprime. So a must not be 1 and a+1 must not be 1 (which is impossible, since a+1 is at least 2 if a is 1). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think again. For a pair [a, a+1], the entire segment is coprime (since a and a+1 are coprime). To be minimal, any proper subsegment (like [a] or [a+1]) must not be coprime. So [a] must not be coprime, which requires that a is not 1 (since gcd(a, a) = a, which is 1 only if a is 1). Similarly, [a+1] must not be coprime, which requires that a+1 is not 1. But a+1 can only be 1 if a is 0, which is impossible since a >=1 (since the problem states that the segment is of positive integers). So, for [a, a+1] to be minimal, a must be 1. Because if a is 1, then [a] is [1], which is coprime. Then the entire segment [1,2] would have [1] as a subsegment, which is coprime. So [1,2] is not minimal. Wait, but that's a contradiction. So in that case, the pair [a, a+1] can't be minimal. Because their subsegments (the individual elements) would be coprime if a is 1 or a+1 is 1. But a is at least 1. So a+1 is at least 2. So [a, a+1] would have [a] and [a+1] as subsegments. [a] is coprime only if a is 1. [a+1] is coprime only if a+1 is 1, which is impossible. So for a pair [a, a+1], the only possible way for it to be minimal is when a is 1. But then [a, a+1] is [1,2], which has [1] as a subsegment. [1] is coprime, so [1,2] is not minimal. Therefore, no pair [a, a+1] can be minimal. But according to the first example, the output is 1, which comes from [1,1]. So the only minimal coprime segments are the single-element segments [1,1], and pairs [a, a+1] where a and a+1 are coprime and their subsegments are not coprime. But this seems impossible. So perhaps the minimal coprime segments are only the single-element segments [1,1], and pairs [a, a+1] where a and a+1 are coprime, and there are no proper subsegments that are coprime. But how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the minimal coprime segments are those where the entire segment is coprime, and there's no way to split it into smaller coprime segments. So for example, a segment [x, y] where x and y are coprime, and there's no way to find a split into [x, a] and [a, y] that are both coprime. But that's not necessarily the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the minimal coprime segments are exactly the intervals [x, x] (single element) where x is 1, and the intervals [x, x+1] where x and x+1 are coprime, and the entire interval is coprime (which they are since consecutive numbers are coprime). But how can such intervals be minimal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's take [2,3]. The entire segment is coprime. The subsegments are [2] and [3]. Both are not coprime (since 2 and 3 are not 1). So the entire segment [2,3] is minimal. So this is a valid minimal coprime segment. So in this case, the pair [2,3] is minimal. So how to account for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All single-element segments [x, x] where x is 1. Because [1,1] is coprime, and there are no proper subsegments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. All pairs [a, a+1] where a and a+1 are coprime (which they always are) and the entire pair is coprime (which they are), and their subsegments (the individual elements) are not coprime. So for [a, a+1], the subsegments [a] and [a+1] must not be coprimes. Which requires that a is not 1 (since [a] would be coprime if a is 1), and a+1 is not 1 (which is impossible). So the only possible pairs that can be minimal are those where a is not 1. Wait, but then [a, a+1] would have [a] as a subsegment. If a is 2, then [2] is not coprime (gcd(2,2)=2). So [2,3] is a pair where the subsegments [2] and [3] are not coprime. So [2,3] is minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the pairs [a, a+1] where a >=2 and a and a+1 are coprime (which they are). So all such pairs are minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but a and a+1 are always coprime, so all pairs [a, a+1] for a >=1 are coprime. But for a >=2, the subsegments [a] and [a+1] are not coprime (since a >=2 implies a and a is not 1, and a+1 >=3, so a+1 and a+1 is not 1). So for a >=2, the pair [a, a+1] is coprime, and its subsegments are not coprime, so it's minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal coprime segments are:\n",

      "\n",
      "- All pairs [a, a+1] where a >=2.\n",

      "Input is 1 2.\n",
      "\n",

      "[2,2] is not coprime (gcd(2,2)=2). So not considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the minimal count is 1. Which matches the sample.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, because 1+8=9. So the sample output for 1-10 is 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another sample: 49 49. The segment is [49,49]. The gcd is 49, which is >1. So not coprime. So the count is 0. Which matches the sample.\n",

      "Another sample: 1 1. Output is 1. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs [a, a+1] where a is in [L, R-1], and a >=1. But wait, no. Because a can be in [L, R-1], but the pair [a, a+1] must be within [L, R]. So a can range from L to R-1. But for each such a, the pair [a, a+1] is a minimal coprime segment if and only if a >=2.

      "Wait, the number of a where a >= L and a >=2 and a <= R-1.\n",
