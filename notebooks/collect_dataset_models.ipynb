This means we can exchange it for a shorter sequence of indices $$$i_2,i_3,\\ldots,i_{k-1}$$$, preserving the values ending up on $$$[l,r]$$$. If we repeat this exchange until it is no longer possible, it will satisfy either:\n",
       "• Every index $$$i$$$ is in $$$[l,n]$$$;\n",
       "• or every index $$$i$$$ is in $$$[1,r]$$$.\n",
       "We can solve for both cases separately. For either case, we can constructively show that we can get the minimum $$$r-l+1$$$ values in the subsegment into $$$[l,r]$$$. The proof is as follows:\n",
       "WLOG assume we are solving for $$$[1,r]$$$, and the indices of the $$$k=r-l+1$$$ minimum values are $$$j_1,j_2,\\ldots,j_k$$$. Then:\n",

       "Thus, we end up with a subsequence of length $$$2x$$$, that gets the minimum $$$k$$$ values into the subsegment $$$[l,r]$$$. As a result, we only have to find the minimum $$$k$$$ values of the subsegment. This can be done easily with sorting. Do this for both $$$[1,r]$$$ and $$$[l,n]$$$, and we get the answer.\n",

       "You can maintain a sorted version of the degree sequence, using a std::multiset, a heap, or possibly even simply a sorted sequence.\n",
       "After you fix the first vertex $$$i$$$, you can find the maximum degree after decreasing the degrees of all adjacent vertices by $$$1$$$. std::multiset can deal with this directly by removing and inserting values, while a heap or a sorted sequence can deal with this by popping elements from the end while the two maximums have the same value. Then, the second vertex is easily the one with maximum degree.\n",
       "Maintaining the degrees takes $$$\\mathcal{O}(d \\log n)$$$ time. As $$$\\sum d = 2m = 2(n-1) = \\mathcal{O}(n)$$$, the total time complexity of this approach is $$$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$$$.\n",
       "• Second Approach: Bruteforcing the Second Vertex\n",
       "If we greedily select the first vertex by degree, we can notice that selecting the first vertex as one with maximum initial degree will find at least one optimal solution. Assume that the first vertex with maximum degree had a maximum value $$$d_i+d_j-2$$$. Then, consider any solution with both vertices' initial degrees strictly less than $$$d_i$$$. This second solution's maximum possible value $$$d_{i'}+d_{j'}-1$$$ will never exceed $$$d_i+d_j-2$$$, because $$$d_{i'}<d_i$$$ and $$$d_{j'} \\le d_j$$$. Thus, at least one optimal answer must have the first vertex as one with maximum initial degree.\n",
       "But we do not know what to do when there are multiple first vertices with maximum initial degree. Luckily, trying only two first vertices with maximum initial degrees will always find one optimal answer. This can be proven by contradiction; If the two first vertices are $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and the second vertex chosen in the bruteforce is $$$w$$$. At least one pair in $$$(u,v)$$$, $$$(u,w)$$$, $$$(v,w)$$$ will be not adjacent, because otherwise it implies the existence of a $$$3$$$-cycle, which can only exist if the graph is not a tree. Thus, if the optimal solution is in the form $$$d_u+d_w-1$$$, trying two first vertices will always find it.\n",
       "Therefore, we can try two vertices greedily for the first vertex and try all other vertices as the second vertex, finding at least one optimal answer in the process.\n",
       "The time complexity of this approach is $$$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$$$ or $$$\\mathcal{O}(n)$$$ depending on how adjacency is checked. Adjacency check in $$$\\mathcal{O}(1)$$$ is possible by preprocessing parents using DFS, because \"$$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are adjacent\" is equivalent to \"$$$par_u=v$$$ or $$$par_v=u$$$\".</td>\n",

For simplicity, we will call an operation where you choose two on $$$y=0$$$ \"Operation A\", and those where you choose two on $$$y=2$$$ \"Operation B\".\n",
       "Let us define a function $$$g(p,q)$$$ as the maximum score after performing \"Operation A\" $$$x$$$ times and \"Operation B\" $$$y$$$ times, assuming it is possible. Then, it is not hard to prove that $$$g(p,q)$$$ equates to the following value:\n",

       "Here, $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are sorted versions of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The proof is left as a practice for the reader; if you want a rigorous proof, an approach using the rearrangement inequality might help you.\n",
       "Then, assuming the value $$$x$$$ is always chosen so that the operations can be performed, the value of $$$f(k)$$$ will be as follows.\n",
       "$$$$$$f(k)= \\max_x{g(x,k-x)}$$$$$$\n",
       "Now we have two questions to ask ourselves:\n",
       "• For what values of $$$x$$$ is it impossible to perform the operations?\n",
       "• How do we maximize this value?\n",
       "The first is relatively easier. We first return to the definition of $$$g(p,q)$$$, and find specific inequalities from it.\n",
       "Then, exactly four inequalities can be found as follows:\n",
       "• $$$2p+q \\le n$$$, because otherwise we will use more than $$$n$$$ points on $$$y=0$$$;\n",
       "• $$$p+2q \\le m$$$, because otherwise we will use more than $$$m$$$ points on $$$y=2$$$;\n",
       "• $$$p \\ge 0$$$, trivially;\n",
       "• $$$q \\ge 0$$$, also trivially.\n",
       "Assigning $$$x$$$ and $$$k-x$$$ to $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ for each inequality, we get the following four inequalities:\n",
       "• $$$2x+k-x = x+k \\le n \\longleftrightarrow x \\le n-k$$$;\n",
       "• $$$x+2(k-x) = 2k-x \\le m \\longleftrightarrow x \\ge 2k-m$$$;\n",
       "• $$$x \\ge 0$$$;\n",
       "• $$$k-x \\ge 0 \\longleftrightarrow x \\le k$$$.\n",
       "Compiling all four inequalities into one inequality, we get the following.\n",
       "$$$$$$\\max(0,2k-m) \\le x \\le \\min(k,n-k)$$$$$$\n",
       "So now we can easily judge if the operations can be performed for some value $$$x$$$. Also, it is easy to see that when the lefthand bound exceeds the righthand bound, it is impossible to perform $$$k$$$ operations. Thus, here we can derive $$$k_\\max$$$. Though it is easy to find a closed form for $$$k_\\max$$$, it is not required for this problem.\n",
       "Now for the next question. Naively computing the values for every $$$x$$$ in the range for all $$$k$$$ takes us $$$\\mathcal{O}(nm)$$$ time. How to do it faster?\n",
       "Again, go back to the definition of $$$g(p,q)$$$. Observe that the value dependent on $$$p$$$ is a prefix sum of a strictly decreasing sequence, and thus is convex. Likewise, the value dependent on $$$q$$$ is also convex. So, given that $$$g(x,k-x)$$$ is a sum of two convex functions of $$$x$$$, $$$g(x,k-x)$$$ is just another convex function of $$$x$$$. Thus, as we already know the range of $$$x$$$, we can perform a ternary search on the range. Note that we are doing ternary search on integers and not on real values, so you might need to take extra care of off-by-one errors.\n",
       "There are other ways to solve this task (also relying a lot on the convexity), like doing binary search instead of ternary search, or performing two pointers for $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$. Anyways, the time complexity is $$$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n + m \\log m)$$$, bounded below by time complexity of sorting.</td>\n",

       "Let us try to first understand what $$$f(x,y)$$$ means. If the two edge lengths are $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (WLOG $$$a \\le b$$$), the third edge length $$$L$$$ must satisfy $$$a+b>L$$$ and $$$a+L>b$$$. This results in the inequality $$$b-a<L<a+b$$$. There are exactly $$$2a-1$$$ values that satisfy this, from $$$b-a+1$$$ to $$$a+b-1$$$. This means, if $$$(u,v)$$$ is a good pair, the following holds.\n",
       "$$$$$$f(u,v)=2 \\cdot \\min(\\text{dist}(u,\\text{lca}(u,v)),\\text{dist}(v,\\text{lca}(u,v)))-1$$$$$$\n",
       "And of course, if $$$(u,v)$$$ is not a good pair, $$$f(u,v)=0$$$ by definition.\n",
       "Naively summing this up for all pairs takes at least $$$\\Theta(n^2)$$$ time. We will simplify the function $$$f(u,v)$$$ into a form that can be computed in batches easily, and provide a different summation that finds the same answer using a double counting proof. The simplified version of $$$f(u,v)$$$ is as follows:\n",
       "$$$$$$\\begin{split} f(u,v) & = 2 \\cdot \\min(\\text{dist}(u,\\text{lca}(u,v)),\\text{dist}(v,\\text{lca}(u,v)))-1 \\\\ & = 2 \\cdot \\min(d_u-d_\\text{lca},d_v-d_\\text{lca})-1 \\\\ & = 2 \\cdot \\min(d_u,d_v)-2 d_\\text{lca} -1 \\end{split}$$$$$$\n",
       "So now we can consider summing up $$$2 \\cdot \\min(d_u,d_v)$$$ and $$$2d_\\text{lca}+1$$$ separately.\n",
       "For the former, consider the condition for vertex $$$u$$$ to decide the value of $$$\\min(d_u,d_v)$$$. For this, $$$d_v$$$ must be no less than $$$d_u$$$, and $$$v$$$ must not be a descendant of $$$u$$$ (because then it will not be a good pair). Therefore, vertex $$$u$$$ decides $$$\\min(d_u,d_v)$$$ for $$$(\\#(d \\ge d_u)-s_u)$$$ different vertices. $$$\\#(d \\ge d_u)$$$ can be computed using a suffix sum of frequency values of $$$d$$$. Thus, we will sum up $$$2 d_u \\cdot (\\#(d \\ge d_u)-s_u)$$$ for all vertices.\n",
       "This only has a very small issue; it counts pairs $$$(u,v)$$$ where $$$d_u=d_v$$$ twice. But thankfully, all of these pairs are good pairs (otherwise they would be the same vertex), and we can simply subtract the sum of $$$2k \\cdot \\binom{\\#(d = k)}{2}$$$ over all $$$k$$$ from the last value.\n",
       "For the latter, consider the condition for vertex $$$w$$$ to be the LCA of $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ should be descendants of $$$w$$$ not equal to $$$w$$$, and they should not be in the same subtree under $$$w$$$ (because then there will be a lower common ancestor). Thus, given that the number of possible descendants is $$$S=s_w-1$$$, we can get the following value for one vertex $$$w$$$ in $$$\\mathcal{O}(\\#(\\text{children}))$$$. Counting for all vertices thus takes $$$\\mathcal{O}(n)$$$ time.\n",
       "$$$$$$\\sum_{par_u=w} {s_u(S-s_u)}$$$$$$\n",
       "This also has a very slight issue; it counts $$$(u,v)$$$ and $$$(v,u)$$$ separately, so we only have to divide this value by $$$2$$$ to get the number of good pairs with vertex $$$w$$$ as LCA. Multiplying $$$2d_w+1$$$ during the summation, we get the sum of the latter value.\n",
       "Thus, we have proved that the following sum yields the very same value that we need:\n",
       "$$$$$$\\sum_{u=1}^n{\\left({2 d_u \\cdot (\\#(d \\ge d_u)-s_u)}\\right)}-\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{\\left({2k \\cdot \\binom{\\#(d = k)}{2}}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{w=1}^n {\\left({(2d_w+1) \\cdot \\sum_{par_u=w}{s_u(s_w-1-s_u)}}\\right)}$$$$$$\n",
       "Everything in this summation is in a form that can be computed in $$$\\mathcal{O}(n)$$$ total time. Therefore, we have solved the problem with time complexity $$$\\mathcal{O}(n)$$$.</td>\n",
